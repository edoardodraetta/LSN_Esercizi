### Exercise 1

Run `make` in `./rng/` to generate `main.exe`, which will run all experiments in exercise 1. 

The jupyter notebook needs to be run sequentially. 

#### TO DO:

[ ] - Is the Cauchy fit a true fit?
[x] - chi2
[ ] - Double check python code
[ ] - Pass average calculation by reference?
[ ] - move data out of rng
[ ] - 2d theta correct

### Exercise 2

[ ] - Importance Sampling
[ ] - Are my RWs correct?
[ ] - improve rw fit
[ ] - Simplify RWs
[ ] - Simplify random.cpp 
[ ] - Simplify functions.cpp
