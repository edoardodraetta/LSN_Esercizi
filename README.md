# lsn_esercizi

LSN exercise delivery.

- [ ] comment on each notebook in italian, making sure to list the relevant experimental parameters
- [ ] trim superfluous modules from programs
- [ ] update c++ style in old programs

### Instructions

Run `make` in `./simulations/esercizio_x` to generate a `main.exe`, which will run all simulations for the given exercise.

### Exercise 1

### Exercise 2

### Exercise 3

### Exercise 4

- [x] Move velocity preparation to function `Prepare()`
- [x] Implement velocity rescale as `Rescale()`
- [x] Implement control flow for velocities
- [x] print penultimate config at end of simulation
- [x] implement restarting as `Restart()`
- [x] accumulate with `Accumulate()`
- [x] complete and print avereage with `Average()`
- [x] make `quick_plot.py` into reporting for temperature equilibration
- [x] solid phase simulation
- [x] liquid phase simulation
- [x] gas phase simulation
- [ ] produce plots in SI units
- [ ] write report describing experiment parameters and procedure

### Exercise 5

- [x] proof of concept
- [x] compute <r> in one block
- [x] compute <r> in multiple blocks
- [x] excited state
- [ ] implement gaussian transition probability for each coordinate
- [ ] plot and report
