okay, here's what i'm thinking...


- A path will be defined as an array of integers.
- A path will be properly constrained according to the problem.

N = [*1*, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...]

>> constraints

	1) Each "address" appears exactly once
	2) The first "address" will never change

- An individual in my population will be represented by a realization of this path.

How do I calculate my cost function?

The cost function needs to know ahead of time the coordinates of each point in the path.

>> idea:

	Pass
